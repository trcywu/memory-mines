//mines to appear in randomized coordinates 
//set number of mines each game, and for every incremental game, increment the mines by 1
//use x and y axis to draw coordinates and maths random to select the numbers between 0-2
// create winning combination, which is to select square on all four sides of existing square ONLY, then avoiding the mines, go from start to finish
